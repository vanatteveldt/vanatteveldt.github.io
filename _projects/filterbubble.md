Can we design news recommenders to nudge users towards diverse consumption of topics and perspectives? The growing role
of news recommenders raises the question of how news diversity can be safeguarded in a digital news landscape. Many
existing studies look at either the supply diversity of recommendations, or the effects of (decreased) exposure
diversity on e.g. polarization and filter bubbles. Research on how users choose from the available supply is lacking,
making it difficult to understand the relation between algorithm design and possible adverse effects on citizens.

We directly address the question of how news recommender algorithms can be designed to optimize exposure diversity. This
innovative and interdisciplinary project builds on our extensive expertise on news diversity, news consumption behavior,
text analysis and recommender design by providing: (WP1) a normative framework for assessing diversity; (WP2) a language
model to automatically measure diversity; (WP3) a model of news consumption choices based on supply, presentation, and
individual characteristics; and (WP4) a concrete prototype implementation of a recommender algorithm that optimizes
exposure diversity, which will be externally validated in a unique field experiment with our media partners.

The project will bridge the gap between differing understandings of news diversity in computer science, communication
science, and media law. This will increase our understanding of contemporary news behavior, yield new language models
for identifying topics and perspectives, and offer concrete considerations for designing recommenders that optimize
exposure diversity. Together with media companies and regulators we turn these scientific insights into concrete
recommendations.
