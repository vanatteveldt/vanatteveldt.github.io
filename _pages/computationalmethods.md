# Book: Computational Analysis of Communication

New textbook on computational methods for analyzing communication published by [Wiley Blackwell](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Computational+Analysis+of+Communication-p-9781119680239). Available [100% open access online](https://cssbook.net) or from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Computational-Analysis-Communication-Wouter-Atteveldt/dp/1119680239)]

Blurb: _In disciplines such as political science, sociology, psychology, and media studies, the use of computational analysis is rapidly increasing. Statistical modeling, machine learning, and other computational techniques are revolutionizing the way electoral results are predicted, social sentiment is measured, consumer interest is evaluated, and much more. Computational Analysis of Communication teaches social science students and practitioners how computational methods can be used in a broad range of applications, providing discipline-relevant examples, clear explanations, and practical guidance._

# R Teaching Materials

Kasper Welbers and I developed a lot of handouts, videos and tutorials on using R for data wrangling, text analysis, and machine learning.
