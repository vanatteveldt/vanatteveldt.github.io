\section{Brief Summary of Research}
  
Due to my interdisciplinary background in Computational Linguistics and Communication Science, I have acquired a
leading position in the budding field of computational communication science, specializing
in the automatic analysis of large collections of political texts.
I acquired various grants (NWO VENI, OC; Digging into Data; Joint E-science/Data Science; ERC H2020, Horizon RIA) to study
susbtantive and methodological aspect of political communication. 
This
resulted in a number of substantive collaborations and articles in the best-cited journals in the
field, including Political Analysis, Journal of Communication, and Political Communication. I currently have an h-index of 24 with over 3,400 citations (Google Scholar).

\hspace{2em} These techniques have been disseminated to a broad audience of social science scholars,
as R packages and as part of the AmCAT text analysis infrastructure that I developed during my PhD project and that
is used in teaching and research projects at various universities. As an indication of the use of
this   software   in   research   and   teaching,   in  2016   alone   442   unique   users  used AmCAT in 494 different projects,
uploading 8,719,400 documents and conducting 9,768 queries.
AmCAT has been cited over 100 times in academic work. 

\hspace{2em} Substantively I contributed to political communication, especially together with the Ph.D.
students I supervise(d): supervised machine learning (Moritz Laurer) news algorithms and diversity (Nicolas Mattis); digital tracking and filter bubbles (Felicia Loecherbach); the role of media logic in recent election campaigns (Janet Takens); the
consequences of increased audience logic and the gatekeeping role of newspapers (Kasper Welbers),
and tabloidization and news quality  (Carina Jacobi). 

\hspace{2em} My   interdisciplinary   background   puts   me   in   a   unique   position   to   continue   to   push   the
methodological state of the art in text analysis.
As part of this effort, I co-founded and chaired (until 2020) the Computational Methods interest group in the International Communication Association (ICA),
and co-founded and chair the CCS.Amsterdam virtual collaborative research lab. 
I am also editor-in-chief and co-founder of the Q1-ranked open access journal Computational Communication Research.
